## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- macOS 10.15 or later
- Python 3.9 or later
- Karabiner-Elements installed
- Git

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/freechorder.git
cd freechorder

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=freechorder

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_chord_manager.py
```

### Code Style

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes

Format your code before committing:

```bash
# Format with black
black src/

# Check style with flake8
flake8 src/
```

## Coding Guidelines

### Python Code

- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle
- Keep functions small and focused
- Avoid global variables

Example:

```python
def add_chord(input_keys: str, output_text: str, category: str = None) -> bool:
    """
    Add a new chord to the library.
    
    Args:
        input_keys: Keys to press simultaneously (e.g., "asd")
        output_text: Text to output when chord is triggered
        category: Optional category for organization
        
    Returns:
        True if chord was added successfully, False otherwise
        
    Raises:
        ChordConflictError: If chord already exists
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:

```
Add dynamic chord sensitivity based on key count

- Implement variable timeout for different chord lengths
- Add configuration option for sensitivity adjustment
- Update all existing chords when config changes

Fixes #123
```

### Branch Naming

- `feature/` for new features
- `fix/` for bug fixes
- `docs/` for documentation updates
- `refactor/` for code refactoring

Examples:
- `feature/add-cloud-sync`
- `fix/chord-timeout-bug`
- `docs/update-installation-guide`

## Testing Guidelines

### What to Test

- All new features must have tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage

### Test Structure

```python
import pytest
from freechorder.core.chord_manager import ChordManager

class TestChordManager:
    """Tests for ChordManager class."""
    
    def test_add_chord_success(self):
        """Test adding a valid chord."""
        manager = ChordManager()
        result = manager.add_chord("asd", "and")
        assert result is True
        
    def test_add_chord_conflict(self):
        """Test adding a conflicting chord raises error."""
        manager = ChordManager()
        manager.add_chord("asd", "and")
        
        with pytest.raises(ChordConflictError):
            manager.add_chord("asd", "different")
```
