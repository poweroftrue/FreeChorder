# FreeChorder Improvements - Better UX & Enhanced Features

## 🎯 What's Been Improved

We've significantly enhanced the chord addition workflow and impulse mode trigger system based on usability research. Here's what's new:

---

## ✨ New Features

### 1. Interactive Chord Addition

**Before** (old way):
```bash
fc add "asd" "and"  # Required both arguments, no confirmation
```

**After** (new way):
```bash
# Option 1: Fully interactive with prompts
fc add
# You'll be prompted for keys and output, with preview and confirmation

# Option 2: Quick with confirmation
fc add "asd" "and"
# Shows preview and asks for confirmation

# Option 3: Super quick (no confirm)
fc add "asd" "and" --no-confirm
# Adds immediately, just like before

# Option 4: Batch add from file
fc add --batch my_chords.txt
```

#### Interactive Mode Features:
- ✅ **Conflict detection BEFORE entering output** - Won't waste your time
- ✅ **Visual preview** - See exactly what you're adding
- ✅ **Confirmation prompt** - Prevents mistakes
- ✅ **Sensitivity display** - Shows timing for the chord
- ✅ **Replace existing** - Option to replace conflicting chords
- ✅ **Better error messages** - Actionable suggestions

#### Example Session:
```bash
$ fc add

🎯 Add New Chord
==================================================
Enter keys to press together: asd

📝 Chord preview: a+d+s
   Keys needed: 3
   Timing: 75ms

Enter what to output: and

✨ Preview:
   When you press: a+d+s
   Output will be: 'and' 

   Save this chord? [Y/n]: y

✅ Chord created successfully!
   a+d+s → 'and'
   The chord is now active system-wide!

💡 Tip: Use 'fc undo' to remove the last chord
```

### 2. Undo Functionality

Made a mistake? Undo it instantly!

```bash
# Undo last chord
fc undo

# Undo last 3 chords
fc undo 3
```

**Example:**
```bash
$ fc undo

🔄 Undoing last 1 chord(s)...
   ✓ Removed: a+d+s → and

✅ Undo complete!
```

### 3. Chord Suggestions

Get suggestions for common chords you haven't added yet:

```bash
fc suggest
```

**Output:**
```bash
💡 Suggested common chords to add:
   1. t+h+e → 'the'
   2. a+n+d → 'and'
   3. t+h+a → 'that'
   4. w+i+t → 'with'
   5. f+o+r → 'for'
   6. t+h+i → 'this'
   7. y+o+u → 'you'
   8. h+a+v → 'have'
   9. f+u+n → 'function'
   10. r+e+t → 'return'

   Use 'fc add "t+h+e" "the"' to add one
```

### 4. Batch Chord Addition

Add multiple chords from a file:

```bash
# Create a file: common_chords.txt
# Format: keys,output (one per line)
```

**Example file (common_chords.txt):**
```
the,the
and,and
tha,that
wit,with
for,for
thi,this
you,you
hav,have
but,but
not,not
# Comments start with #
fun,function
ret,return
imp,import
```

**Add them all:**
```bash
fc add --batch common_chords.txt
```

**Output:**
```bash
📦 Batch Add: 13 chords
==================================================

➤ the → the
✅ Chord created successfully!
   ...

➤ and → and
✅ Chord created successfully!
   ...

==================================================
✅ Added: 13 chords
```

### 5. Improved Error Messages

**Before:**
```bash
$ fc add "asd" "and"
✗ Error: Chord already exists: a+d+s
```

**After:**
```bash
$ fc add "asd" "and"

⚠️  Chord a+d+s already exists!
   Current output: 'and'

   Would you like to replace it? [y/N]: n
   ✗ Chord addition cancelled
```

## 🔧 Configuration Improvements

### Customizable Impulse Triggers

Edit `~/.config/freechorder/config.yaml`:

```yaml
impulse:
  enabled: true
  trigger_key: 'cmd+shift+i'  # Change to your preference
  chord_timeout_ms: 100
  min_chord_size: 2
  sensitivity_scaling:
    2_keys: 50
    3_keys: 75
    4_keys: 100
    5_plus_keys: 125
  audio_feedback: true  # Future feature
```

**Planned trigger options:**
- Custom keyboard shortcuts
- Voice activation (future)
- Menu bar icon click (future)
- Touch Bar button (future)
