# FreeChorder üéπ

A software-based CharaChorder alternative for macOS that brings chord-based typing to any keyboard using Karabiner-Elements as the backend.

## What is FreeChorder?

FreeChorder is a terminal application that allows you to:
- Define keyboard chords (simultaneous key combinations) that output text or commands
- Manage chords through a simple CLI interface
- Create chords on-the-fly with impulse chording
- Search and organize your chord library
- Import existing CharaChorder chord libraries
- Fine-tune chord detection sensitivity to match your typing speed (automatically updates all existing chords!)

Think of it as text expansion on steroids - instead of typing full words or phrases, you can press multiple keys at once to instantly output the text you need.

### ‚ö° Performance Options

| Mode | Startup Time | Features | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Regular (`fc impulse`) | ~2 seconds | Full features, accessibility checks | Learning & configuration |
| Quick (`fcq` or Cmd+Opt+Del) | ~0.5 seconds | Minimal startup, batch sync | Frequent chord creation |
| Native (Shift+Opt+Del) | Instant! | Dialog-based, no Python | Ultra-fast single chords |

## Example Usage

```bash
# ===== ADDING CHORDS =====

# Interactive mode - Best for beginners (prompts for everything)
fc add

# Quick add with preview and confirmation
fc add "asd" "and"

# Super quick - no confirmation (for power users)
fc add "the" "the" --no-confirm

# Add with category
fc add "fun" "function" --category "programming"

# Batch add from file
fc add --batch my_chords.txt

# Get suggestions for common chords
fc suggest


# ===== MANAGING CHORDS =====

# List all chords
fc list

# Search for chords
fc search "and"

# Remove a chord
fc remove "asd"

# Undo last chord addition (lifesaver!)
fc undo

# Undo last 3 additions
fc undo 3

# View statistics
fc stats

# Detailed statistics breakdown
fc stats --detailed


# ===== IMPULSE MODE (Create Chords While Typing) =====

# Enter impulse mode - creates chords on-the-fly
fc impulse

# Quick launch impulse mode with keyboard shortcuts:
# - Ctrl+Option+Delete: Regular mode (~2 sec startup)
# - Cmd+Option+Delete: Quick mode (~0.5 sec startup) ‚ö°
# - Shift+Option+Delete: Native dialog (instant!) ‚ö°‚ö°

# Sync quick chords after using fast modes
fc sync


# ===== CONFIGURATION =====

# Activate the FreeChorder profile in Karabiner
fc activate

# Configure chord sensitivity (automatically updates all chords!)
fc config --chord-timeout 150  # More forgiving for slower typing
fc config --chord-timeout 75   # Tighter timing for faster typists
fc config --show               # Show current configuration

# Refresh all chords with current settings
fc refresh

# Export chords to modular JSON files
fc export --format modular  # Separate files by length/category
fc export --format integrated  # Single Karabiner config (default)


# ===== CHORD GROUPS =====

# Manage chord groups (enable/disable sets of chords)
fc groups --list  # Show all groups and their status
fc groups --disable "2-Key Chords (Quick)"  # Disable all 2-key chords
fc groups --enable "3-Key Chords (Standard)"  # Re-enable 3-key chords


# ===== PERMISSIONS =====

# Check accessibility permissions (needed for impulse mode)
fc permissions
```

### Modular Configuration

FreeChorder now supports modular rule organization, inspired by best practices from the chording community:

- **Separate rule files**: Export chords to individual JSON files grouped by length or category
- **Better maintainability**: Each file contains related chords, making it easier to manage
- **Selective enabling**: Enable/disable entire groups of chords without deleting them
- **Version control friendly**: Smaller, focused files are easier to track in git

To use modular configuration:
```bash
# Export to separate files
freechorder export --format modular

# Files are saved to ~/.config/freechorder/karabiner_rules/
# Copy them to Karabiner's complex modifications folder:
cp ~/.config/freechorder/karabiner_rules/*.json ~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/

# Then enable them in Karabiner-Elements UI
```

### Dynamic Sensitivity

FreeChorder now automatically adjusts chord detection sensitivity based on the number of keys:

- **2-key chords**: 50ms (strict) - Prevents accidental triggers during fast typing
- **3-key chords**: 75ms (moderate) - Balanced sensitivity
- **4-key chords**: 100ms (default) - Standard timing
- **5+ key chords**: 125ms (relaxed) - More time for complex chords

This ensures that simple 2-letter combinations don't trigger accidentally while still allowing comfortable timing for complex chords.

### Keyboard Shortcuts & Fast Launch Options

FreeChorder includes multiple ways to start impulse mode, from regular to ultra-fast:

#### System-wide Shortcuts (when FreeChorder profile is active):
- **`Ctrl+Option+Delete`**: Regular impulse mode (~2 seconds startup)
- **`Cmd+Option+Delete`**: Quick impulse mode (~0.5 seconds startup) ‚ö°
- **`Shift+Option+Delete`**: Native dialog mode (instant - no Python!) ‚ö°‚ö°

#### Terminal Commands:
- `fc impulse` - Regular impulse mode with all features
- `fcq` - Quick impulse mode (minimal startup time)
- `fc sync` - Sync quick chords to Karabiner after using fast modes

### Using Fast Modes

The quick modes (fcq and native dialog) save chords to a cache for speed. Remember to sync them:

```bash
# After creating chords with fcq or native dialog:
fc sync  # This activates your new chords in Karabiner

# First time setup for fcq alias:
source ~/.zshrc  # Or restart terminal
```
