# FreeChorder üéπ

A software-based CharaChorder alternative for macOS that brings chord-based typing to any keyboard using Karabiner-Elements as the backend.

## What is FreeChorder?

FreeChorder is a terminal application that allows you to:
- Define keyboard chords (simultaneous key combinations) that output text or commands
- Manage chords through a simple CLI interface
- Create chords on-the-fly with impulse chording
- Search and organize your chord library
- Import existing CharaChorder chord libraries
- Fine-tune chord detection sensitivity to match your typing speed (automatically updates all existing chords!)

Think of it as text expansion on steroids - instead of typing full words or phrases, you can press multiple keys at once to instantly output the text you need.

### ‚ö° Performance Options

| Mode | Startup Time | Features | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Regular (`fc impulse`) | ~2 seconds | Full features, accessibility checks | Learning & configuration |
| Quick (`fcq` or Cmd+Opt+Del) | ~0.5 seconds | Minimal startup, batch sync | Frequent chord creation |
| Native (Shift+Opt+Del) | Instant! | Dialog-based, no Python | Ultra-fast single chords |

## Example Usage

```bash
# Add a chord: pressing a+s+d simultaneously outputs "and"
freechorder add "asd" "and"

# Add another chord for "the"
freechorder add "teh" "the"

# Search for chords
freechorder search "and"

# List all chords
freechorder list


# Enter impulse mode to create chords while typing
freechorder impulse
# or use the shortcut: fc impulse

# Quick launch impulse mode: 
# - Press Ctrl+Option+Delete for regular mode
# - Press Cmd+Option+Delete for fast mode (‚ö° ~0.5s startup)
# - Press Shift+Option+Delete for instant dialog (‚ö°‚ö° no delay!

# Activate the FreeChorder profile in Karabiner
freechorder activate

# Configure chord sensitivity (default: 100ms)
# This automatically updates ALL existing chords to use the new timing!
freechorder config --chord-timeout 150  # More forgiving for slower typing
freechorder config --chord-timeout 75   # Tighter timing for faster typists
freechorder config --show               # Show current configuration

# Refresh all chords with current settings (including dynamic sensitivity)
freechorder refresh

# Export chords to modular JSON files for better organization
freechorder export --format modular  # Creates separate files by chord length/category
freechorder export --format integrated  # Updates single Karabiner config (default)

# Manage chord groups (enable/disable groups of chords)
freechorder groups --list  # Show all groups and their status
freechorder groups --disable "2-Key Chords (Quick)"  # Disable all 2-key chords
freechorder groups --enable "3-Key Chords (Standard)"  # Re-enable 3-key chords
```

### Modular Configuration

FreeChorder now supports modular rule organization, inspired by best practices from the chording community:

- **Separate rule files**: Export chords to individual JSON files grouped by length or category
- **Better maintainability**: Each file contains related chords, making it easier to manage
- **Selective enabling**: Enable/disable entire groups of chords without deleting them
- **Version control friendly**: Smaller, focused files are easier to track in git

To use modular configuration:
```bash
# Export to separate files
freechorder export --format modular

# Files are saved to ~/.config/freechorder/karabiner_rules/
# Copy them to Karabiner's complex modifications folder:
cp ~/.config/freechorder/karabiner_rules/*.json ~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/

# Then enable them in Karabiner-Elements UI
```

### Dynamic Sensitivity

FreeChorder now automatically adjusts chord detection sensitivity based on the number of keys:

- **2-key chords**: 50ms (strict) - Prevents accidental triggers during fast typing
- **3-key chords**: 75ms (moderate) - Balanced sensitivity
- **4-key chords**: 100ms (default) - Standard timing
- **5+ key chords**: 125ms (relaxed) - More time for complex chords

This ensures that simple 2-letter combinations don't trigger accidentally while still allowing comfortable timing for complex chords.

### Keyboard Shortcuts & Fast Launch Options

FreeChorder includes multiple ways to start impulse mode, from regular to ultra-fast:

#### System-wide Shortcuts (when FreeChorder profile is active):
- **`Ctrl+Option+Delete`**: Regular impulse mode (~2 seconds startup)
- **`Cmd+Option+Delete`**: Quick impulse mode (~0.5 seconds startup) ‚ö°
- **`Shift+Option+Delete`**: Native dialog mode (instant - no Python!) ‚ö°‚ö°

#### Terminal Commands:
- `fc impulse` - Regular impulse mode with all features
- `fcq` - Quick impulse mode (minimal startup time)
- `fc sync` - Sync quick chords to Karabiner after using fast modes

### Using Fast Modes

The quick modes (fcq and native dialog) save chords to a cache for speed. Remember to sync them:

```bash
# After creating chords with fcq or native dialog:
fc sync  # This activates your new chords in Karabiner

# First time setup for fcq alias:
source ~/.zshrc  # Or restart terminal
```
